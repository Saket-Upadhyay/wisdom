The central character in the series is Harry Potter a boy who lives in the fictional town of Little Whinging Surrey with his aunt uncle and cousin – the Dursleys – and discovers at the age of eleven that he is a wizard though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles   The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world albeit hidden and in secrecy His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world   Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place As Harry develops through his adolescence he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical social and emotional including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships infatuation romantic relationships schoolwork and exams anxiety depression stress and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that lies ahead in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war  Each novel chronicles one year in Harry's life  during the period from 1991 to 1998  The books also contain many flashbacks which are frequently experienced by Harry viewing the memories of other characters in a device called a Pensieve  The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture European folklore classical mythology and alchemy incorporating objects and wildlife such as magic wands magic plants potions spells flying broomsticks centaurs and other magical creatures and the Philosopher's Stone beside others invented by Rowling While the fantasy land of Narnia is an alternate universe and the Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth a mythic past the wizarding world of Harry Potter exists parallel to the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life with the action mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts) the West Country Devon London and Surrey in southeast England [13] The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets ancient pubs lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population   Early years When the first novel of the series Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone opens it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world – an event so very remarkable that even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually throughout the series After the introductory chapter the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed  Despite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities  their efforts are in vain Harry meets a half-giant Rubeus Hagrid who is also his first contact with the wizarding world Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry's history  Harry learns that as a baby he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard Lord Voldemort (more commonly known by the magical community as You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and by Albus Dumbledore as Tom Marvolo Riddle) who subsequently attempted to kill him as well  Instead the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse  As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world However at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard Albus Dumbledore the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant Muggle relatives the Dursleys who have kept him safe but treated him poorly including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating him as their servant Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years from age eleven to seventeen  With Hagrid's help Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts As Harry begins to explore the magical world the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley a fun-loving member of an ancient large happy but poor wizarding family and Hermione Granger a gifted bright and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage   Harry also encounters the school's potions master Severus Snape who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort who in his quest to regain a body yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold   The series continues with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley enrols in her first year at Hogwarts and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be the diary of a previous student Tom Marvolo Riddle written during World War II He is later revealed to be Voldemort's younger self who is bent on ridding the school of "mudbloods" a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage The memory of Tom Riddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the diary Voldemort is able to possess her  Through the diary Ginny acts on Voldemort's orders and unconsciously opens the "Chamber of Secrets" unleashing an ancient monster later revealed to be a basilisk which begins attacking students at Hogwarts It kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly The book also introduces a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart a highly cheerful self-conceited wizard with a pretentious facade later turning out to be a fraud Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the Wizarding World through delving into the school's history and learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from Muggles  Harry also learns that his ability to speak the snake language Parseltongue is rare and often associated with the Dark Arts When Hermione is attacked and petrified Harry and Ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets with Harry destroying the diary for good and saving Ginny and as they learn later also destroying a part of Voldemort's soul The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy Draco's father and rival of Ron and Ginny's father to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny's belongings  The third novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban follows Harry in his third year of magical education It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form only being mentioned Instead Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by Sirius Black his father's best friend and according to the Wizarding World an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school he reaches out to Remus Lupin a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend Peter Pettigrew who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat Scabbers  In this book a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher none of whom lasts more than one school year
